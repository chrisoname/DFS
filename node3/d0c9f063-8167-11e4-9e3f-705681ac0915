ntly on me the judge a sentence past,
  To the place of execution they brought me to a tree,
  And may God forgive my mistress for she has wronged me.

  All you who come to see me now, hear before I die,
  Don't laugh at my downfall nor smile at my disgrace,
  Believe me I'm quite innocent, I bid this world adieu,
  Farewell my dearest Polly, I die thro' loving you.

  Ye Stockton lads and lasses too,
    Come listen to my story,
  A dismal tale, because 'tis true,
    I've now to lay before ye;
  We must away, our rout is come,
    We scarce refrain from tears O,
  Shrill shrieks the fife, rough roars the drum,
    March, Yorkshire Volunteers, O.
